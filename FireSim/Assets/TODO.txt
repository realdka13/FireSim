WildfireManager
    Tick speed will need to correlate to game speed

FireChanceIndicator
    Fix
    Updates values on tick rather than every frame
        Remove stuff from update
    Take Range Into account
    Recalculate % to light on fire based on number of spark points, and # of objects on fire around it
    Move to a HUD rather than in the enviro?

SparkPoint
    enviro Variables
        Sunlight
    Put them all together - have a way to disable
    minimal global variables in this script?
    Gizmos not quite working
    Remove sparkRadius
    Clean and Optimize - like adding arguments to an array

    Enviro variables
        Topography
    Remove temp global starting burning
    Add more fuel types (dead things?)

Other
    Clean Inspector Variables
    Organize Project folders
    Handle the multiple cameras better (making sure their values stay the same by maybe spawning other cam at runtime)
    Fire jumping from wind

How to play
    Keep in mind number of things on fire around object increases its chance
